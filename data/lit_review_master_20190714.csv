The area should: (i) be previously classified as agriculture or pasture for at least five consecutive years; (ii) have at least five connected pixels also classified as restored forest; (iii) be classified as forest in 2017; (iv) be classified as forest for at least three consecutive years; and (v) should not be a commercial tree plantation. The Pact detected 906,452 ha of degraded/deforested lands under restoration from 2011 to 2015 (and maintained up to 2017) within the Atlantic Forest. The restored forest classification accuracy was 78%, with most misclassification arising from commercial tree plantations (14%) and old-growth forest (6%). On this basis we estimate that 673,510 and 740,555 ha of forest was restored between 2011 and 2015. A preliminary estimation performed with the Pact's database of restoration projects suggests that nearly 300,000 ha of restored forests have been established through active restoration interventions by its ?350 members.""
